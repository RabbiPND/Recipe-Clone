            <h3><u>Burritos Recipe</u></h3>
            <p>A burrito(s) is a common food item of Mexican and American origin consisting of a tortilla wrapped around a mixed filling of such ingredients as meat, cheese, beans, and vegetables.</p>
        
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour tortilla(TRADITIONAL)</li>
                    <li>Meat filling(TRADITIONAL)</li>
                    <li>Beans(TRADITIONAL)</li>
                    <li>Salsa(TRADITIONAL)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese(POPULAR)</li>
                    <li>Sour cream(POPULAR)</li>
                    <li>Rice(POPULAR)</li>
                    <li>Vegetables(POPULAR)</li>
                </ul>
    
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat your oven to 350Â° F and then go to work. First, set up your mise en place: your meat of choice, heated refried beans (canned is fine), cooked long grain rice, grated cheese (swiss, jack, cheddar, or a mix) or crumbled queso fresco, chopped cilantro (optional), chopped cabbage, salsa of your preference -- homemade is best, but you can use a jarred salsa. I like the Rick Bayless tomatillo style</li>
                    <li>Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil just larger than the big flour tortilla you are about to lay on top of it. You need the largest tortilla you can find for this -- I use 10-inch. Next, cover the midsection of your tortilla with a layer of beans and your cheese of choice. Spoon on some rice, chopped cabbage, a sprinkle of cilantro, and then a generous drizzle of salsa. That's the fill.</li>
                    <li>Next: the fold and the wrap. Pretend you are facing north. Fold over the east and west sides to cover the ingredients by about a third of the way from each end.</li>
                    <li>Now pull the south side (closest to you) over the ingredients, allowing a margin at the far end. Pull toward you as you roll northward. Seal by pushing everything on top of that last bare margin of tortilla. Sometimes it helps to dip a finger in water and run it along the margin first. You might need to poke the ends in a bit to keep tucked.</li>
                    <li>To finish, wrap the burrito in the foil in exactly the same way you folded the tortilla. Bake this in the oven for 8 minutes. Lunch is ready.</li>
                </ol>
